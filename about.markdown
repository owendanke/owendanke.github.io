Howdy I'm Owen Danke the *webmaster/author* of this website. 
This website is where I document various projects I have worked on.
These may be related to programming, amateur radio, and anything else of interest.

I graduated from Clarkson University in 2025 with a fondness for backend software development.
While at Clarkson I found K2CC, the amatuer radio club on campus, and started my pathway into amatuer radio as KC1SEZ.
