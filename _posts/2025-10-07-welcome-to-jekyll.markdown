I finally got around to putting together a static website for myself. I don't know how much I'll be using it so I am sticking with the github.io domain for now.
As you can tell from the default post title, I am using Jekyll to build the website. I'm not a fan of front-end design, especially when it comes to websites, but Jekyll makes it more interesting with all the `_includes` and `_layouts`.

My current idea for this website is for it to serve and share projects that I have worked on to who ever stumbles upon it. I hope people find these projects interesting and the posts educational.

I decided to leave the rest of the default Jekyll post for the URLs. Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
